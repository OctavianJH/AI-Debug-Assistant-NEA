AI-Debug-Assistant-NEA: Due to privacy reasons and the exam board's instruction the code of the project cannot be public, however if you have any questions feel free to reach out.

Overview:
This project is my A Level Computer Science **NEA (Non-Examined Assessment)**
The aim is to build an AI Debug Assistant that helps beginner Python programmers by identifying, explaining, and suggesting fixes for common coding errors.
It will also track the mistakes the commonly make, and then provide them with different tasks/problems they can complete to improve.

The application is being developed as a Flask web app, with plans to integrate natural language processing for explanations.  

Features:
- Detects common Python errors and bugs.  
- Explains issues in beginner-friendly language.  
- Suggests fixes or improvements.  
- Web-based interface built with Flask.  

Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- Flask  
- HTML / CSS / JS (for frontend)
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- NumPy/Pandas
